# ðŸŒ³ Trees Generator ðŸŒ³

![tree](https://github.com/akihiko47/Trees-Generator/blob/main/trees/first_tree.png?raw=true)

A random tree generator using turtle, python, and L-systems. You can see examples of generated trees in the `trees` folder

## Usage
1. You can copy the directory to make changes using ```git clone https://github.com/akihiko47/Trees-Generator.git``` or download `.zip` arichve.
2. Configure settings
3. Wait for result

## Settings
1. `end_gen = 11` The last generation in the algorithm. The larger the value, the more beautiful the trees will be, but they will take much longer to generate.
2. `angle = 15` Standard branch offset angle. The larger the value, the wider the tree will be.
3. `rand_angle_max = 13` The maximum value of the random deviation of the branches. The larger the value, the more random the trees will be.
4. `thick = 16` Width of the tree trunk.
5. `dist = 10` Length of tree branches.
